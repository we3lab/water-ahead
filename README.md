# Water Associated Health and Environmental Air Damages Tool

This is the GUI development project for the Water AHEAD (Water Associated Health and Environmental Air Damages) Tool.

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Creating an instance of the GUI using Python
To create the GUI using Python (rather than by installing the GUI), run the trace_element_GUI.py file located in the Code/GUI directory.

### Installing the GUI 
To install the COALS Controls GUI download the COALS Controls Model.msi file.  After the download completes, double click to run the file.  The installer will start.  You will need to select a location and the file will then install the executable.

This GUI is currently only for Windows machines.  An Apple version is currently in development.
